Particleswap is the first decentralised Swap incubator for DeFi projects.
The aim is to provide Devs and companies with a platform where they can pitch their product to the public.
The ParticleSwap Protocol is designed to bring new solutions to the Defi space, a Decentralized protocol that aims to give to the community access to several instruments to expand the adoption of Blockchain technologies in daily life.
All the projects are evaluated directly by the public by funding them, which makes ParticleSwap entirely democratic.
Various DeFi products are introduced, such as: cross-chain operations,
token swapping, yield farming, margin trading, and many more.
All these features are built to provide a wide range of opportunities for the users to profit from the platform.
A protocol built to revamp existing Decentralized Finance (DEFI) products while introducing several innovative DEFI products to boost and support scalability, security, improve user experience and adoption.
ParticleSwap is going to leave a footprint in the Defi space like Bitcoin did in 2009 or the ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and big exchanges, like Binance, blew up the Crypto space in 2017.
